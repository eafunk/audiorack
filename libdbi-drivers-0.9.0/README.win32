libdbi-drivers - drivers for libdbi, the Database
Independent Abstraction Layer for C

WINDOWS-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------------

libdbi-drivers can be compiled into DLL files on Win32 with the Cygwin
package, available at http://www.cygwin.com/. libdbi must be properly
installed before attempting to build libdbi-drivers, and you need the
appropriate client libraries of the database engines. The only
database engine packaged with Cygwin is PostgreSQL. However, at least
SQLite, SQLite3 and MySQL build out of the box.

To build a particular driver, run these commands, where:

- XYZ is one of msql, mysql, pgsql, or sqlite for MiniSQL, MySQL, 
  PostgreSQL, and SQLite, respectively

- /path/to/lib is (usually) /usr/local/lib/mysql for MySQL and
  /usr/local/msql3/lib for MiniSQL. The LDFLAGS magic is not required
  for building the PostgreSQL and SQLite drivers.

./configure --with-driverXYZ
make
make install
make libXYZ-dll -f Makefile.w32 LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib"
make install-libXYZ -f Makefile.w32

If you want to build and install all drivers, use the following commands:
./configure --with-mysql --with-pgsql --with-msql --with-sqlite
make
make install
make -f Makefile.w32 LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/mysql -L/usr/local/msql3/lib"
make install -f Makefile.w32

The good news is that this works at all. The bad news is that the DLL magic 
could be integrated into the standard Makefiles with some extra effort
and a better understanding of the autotools.

CYGWIN DETAILS:
---------------

There are unfortunately no "Cygwin" releases in a sense as there are Debian 2.2
or FreeBSD 4.5. However, libdbi-drivers should work with any Cygwin release
since around Jan 2003.


USAGE:
------

Once libdbi is compiled for Win32 and you have a DLL, you can use that DLL like
any other. The only requirement is that the cygwin runtime DLL is available on
the target machine also, since non-Windows API functions are implemented by
cygwin.


MODIFICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTION (GPL):
