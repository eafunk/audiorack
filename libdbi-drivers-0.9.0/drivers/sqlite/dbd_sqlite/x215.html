>And now we have to discuss how successful the sqlite driver is in squeezing the SQLite idea of a database engine into the libdbi framework which was shaped after MySQL and PostgreSQL. Keep in mind that the limitations mentioned here are not intrinsic, that is a sufficient amount of coding might fix these problems eventually.</P

>The typeless nature of SQLite has some nasty consequences. The sqlite driver takes great care to reconstruct the type of a field that you request in a query, but this isn't always successful. Some of the functions that SQLite supports work both on numeric and text data. The sqlite driver currently cannot deduce the field type correctly as it would have to check all arguments of each function. Instead the sqlite driver makes a few assumptions that may be right or wrong in a given case. The affected functions are <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>coalesce(X,Y,...)</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>max(X)</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>min(X)</CODE
>, and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>count(X)</CODE
>.</P

>The sqlite driver currently assumes that the directory separator of your filesystem is a slash (/). This may be wrong on your particular system. It is not a problem for Windows systems as long as the sqlite driver is built with the Cygwin tools (see <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README.win32</TT
>).</P

>Listing tables with the <CODE

>The sqlite driver assumes that table and field names do not exceed 128 characters in length, including the trailing \0. I don't know whether SQLite internally has such a limit or not (both MySQL and PostgreSQL have a lower limit). The limit can be increased by changing a single #define in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dbd_sqlite.h</TT
> header file.</P

>In a few cases, the sqlite driver expects you to type SQL keywords in all lowercase or all uppercase, but not mixed. This holds true for the 'from' in a SELECT statement. Type it either as 'from' or as 'FROM', but refrain from using 'fRoM' or other funny mixtures of uppercase and lowercase. Most other database engines treat the keywords as case-insensitive and would accept all variants.</P
