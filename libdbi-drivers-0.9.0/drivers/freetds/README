FreeTDS DRIVER:
---------------

This driver allows libdbi-enabled applications to use MS SQL Server or
Sybase as a database backend.

Some hints how to use this driver:

In /etc/locales.conf should be set date format to  %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
It's need for date format converting.

As "hostname" we can use
  1) "IP";
  2) "domaine name" or 
  3) "name of database section in /etc/freetds.conf"


See the included driver documentation for installation instructions, usage,
and information about driver-specific peculiarities - once that
documentation has been written, that is.
