libdbi-drivers NEWS file
========================

______________________________________
0.9.0 (the "Lightning Blue Eyes" release)

- some of the drivers now export client library functions to the
  programmer via the dbi_driver_specific_function() interface

- if necessary, the drivers now support libdbi instances

- a segfault in the oracle driver caused by INSERT statements was
  fixed

- the pgsql driver now supports features specific to PostgreSQL 9 and later

- drivers now support transactions and savepoints if the underlying
  database engines do

- additional libdbi hint about position in a result set allows tremendous
  speedup of sequential reads from MySQL result sets

- various memory leaks were plugged

- database specific test scripts allow tests without affecting existing
  database clusters

- completely rewritten test kit increases coverage and improves error
  reporting


__________________________________________
0.8.3 (the "Shores of California" release)

- major overhaul of the firebird driver. The driver is now linked to
  libfbembed.so instead of libfbclient.so. You can request a local
  connection (bypassing the server altogether) by using an empty
  hostname, or a local connection through the server by using
  "localhost" or the actual computer name as the hostname.

- changed all driver code to LGPL, and all doc code to GFDL with no
  invariant sections as requested by several packagers

- made linking drivers against libdbi the default. This behaviour can be
  switched off by --disable-libdbi, a reversal of the previous default

- improved support for MySQL and PostgreSQL connection options

- assorted fixes for MinGW compatibility

- all drivers now implement the "safe_dlclose" driver capability to
  signal libdbi whether or not the driver can safely be unloaded from
  memory.


_____________________________________
0.8.2 (the "Payday in a Pub" release)

- to avoid possible conflicts with database client libraries (think
  package names!) all driver libraries were renamed from libname.suffix
  to libdbdlibname.suffix. E.g. the MySQL shared library was renamed from
  mysql.so to libdbdmysql.so. Unless your package manager does this
  automatically, it is recommended to clean out old driver libraries
  from /usr/local/lib/dbd (or wherever they ended up).
  Remember that this change affects only the library names. The driver
  names (the ones your program uses to load particular drivers) did
  *not* change 

- assorted fixes in the oracle driver

- the mysql driver now supports the BIT and NEWDECIMAL types
  introduced in MySQL 5.0.3

- added a new (experimental) Ingres 2006 driver

- the "--disable-docs" configure switch now allows to build
  libdbi-drivers without having the sgml toolchain installed

- plugged a few memory holes

- fixed a segfault in the error message handling code of sqlite/sqlite3

- improved compatibility with older PostgreSQL versions

- sqlite and sqlite3 now grok semicolons in query strings

- you can now optionally link the drivers against libdbi by using the
  "--enable-libdbi" configure switch. This sounds weird at first, but it
  allows to load libdbi into a dlopen'ed module, like this:

  Parent => dl_open(module) => dl_open(libdbi) => dl_open(driver)

  Drivers compiled with this option should work ok in the regular
  context (your app linked against libdbi) as well.


__________________________
0.8.1 (the "Lost" release)

Due to a lack of attention there was no release information added at
the time of the 0.8.1 release. It is therefore entirely obscure what
made us feel like wrapping up a new release, but rest assured that
this code was better than before (if you really need to know, use the
CVS logs or the CVS web interface).

_____________________________________
0.8.0 (the "Whatsername" release)

- and then there were 7: sqlite3, firebird, and oracle were
  added. However, msql, oracle, and firebird are still experimental in
  this release and are likely to be broke. We'll do our best to ship
  working drivers with 0.8.1

- tons of internal fixes to work with libdbi 0.8.0

- the version numbering has changed. Starting with this release, the
  major and minor numbers ("0.8" in this release) denote the internal
  API version. Any 0.8.x libdbi-drivers release is guaranteed to work
  with any 0.8.x libdbi release. The patch level ("0" in the current
  release) denotes patches and minor changes that do not affect the
  internal API.


_____________________________________
0.7.0 (the "Pineapple Skunk" release)

- the libdbi-drivers project now hosts 4 drivers: mysql and pgsql
  (formerly part of libdbi), as well as msql and sqlite.

- fixed dynamic loading stuff to work properly on OSX

- added/updated driver documentation

- improved test program

- assorted fixes in the drivers

- sqlite driver now attempts to support all MySQL and PosgreSQL data
  types
