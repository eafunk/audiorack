Tests cases to libdbi framework
======================================

The tests they are in this directory are to cover the functions describe in the
libdbi reference guide. Each *.c file covers specific functions and are
grouped following the documentation.

We are using the Cgreen unit test framework. You will need the Cgreen
to execute the tests. You can get it, http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgreen,
compiling and install in your system. 

Fortunately the libdbi test framework provide it for you. No worry about it.
 
Steps to execute the tests
==============================

- Local tests:

* Install Cgreen (optional, we provide it)
* cd ~/libdbi-drivers/tests
* make check
* answers the questions about your database engine
* see the results of the tests.

- How to submit the tests results to dashboard

* You will need install the cmake package. It provides the 
  ctest tool which we use to submit the tests results. You can
  get it from www.cmake.org or check with your distro packages.

* Edit the file test_dbi.cfg (which was generated by ./configure script)
  and changes:
  type=[can be Experimental or Continuous or Nightly]
  tag=[tag to identify your build]
  dbengine strings
 
 You can change 'sitename' if you want.
 
* Run the script ./run_test.sh. It will start dbi_test with correct 
  options to generate a CDash reporter. 
* When the script finished CTest will automatically submitted the results 
  to a dashboard.
* Now you can see the results at http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=libdbi-drivers

Notes
=====

Submit the tests results to a dashboard is a very useful because the developers can 
see what happens more quickly without the need of cut-and-paste the tests results
in mail list. We can see too how many platforms the libdbi framework runs, checking build and
configure, tests coverage and more others things.
